This file contains a list of maintainers for the meta-ivi layer.

Please submit any patches against meta-ivi to the maintainers
(cc:ing the Yocto Project mailing list (yocto@yoctoproject.org))

You may also contact the maintainers directly in case you have any questions
on a particular meta-ivi topic, but please try to do the following first:

  - look in the Yocto Project Bugzilla
    (http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a problem has
    already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the Yocto mailing list archives
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/) to see if other
    people have run into similar problems or had similar questions
    answered.
