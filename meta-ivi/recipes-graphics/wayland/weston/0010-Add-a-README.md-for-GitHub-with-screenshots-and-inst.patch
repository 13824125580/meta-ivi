+
+## Description
+
+ <strong>IVI-Shell</strong> provides a shell interface for Weston, which maps the GENIVI API (http://www.genivi.org) for In-Vehicle Infotainment.
+
+ This repository provides the upstream Weston, with the IVI-Shell patches integrated in the master branch or most common release branches. It will be updated frequently. It may be helpful to test the most recent IVI-Shell patches with the most recent Weston.
