Instructions on how to use this project for an arm build.|
+=================================================================+

1) This project must not be stored onto an encrypted partition as yocto has some issues when dealing with encrypted partitions.

   See http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html under "The Packages" for a list of required packages needed when using yocto on a specific linux distribution.

2) Create your new build directory: source yocto-ivi/oe-init-build-env

3) Optional: Edit your newly created conf/local.conf; uncomment a MACHINE of your choice (vexpressa9 is enabled by default. Available machines at this time: vexpressa9)

4) Optional: in conf/local.conf uncomment BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4" and PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4".

5) $ bitbake discovery-image

6) Run the emulator:
   $ runqemu discovery-image <selected machine>
   for example, to boot the default selected machine (vexpressa9  - Cortex A9) you would use:
        runqemu discovery-image vexpressa9
