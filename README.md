meta-ivi, the Yocto layer for In-Vehicle Infotainment
=====================================================

This layer's purpose is to add In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) support when
used with Poky.  The goal is to make the Yocto Project reference system
Poky GENIVI compliant.

Please see the
[MAINTAINERS](http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-ivi/tree/MAINTAINERS)
file for information on contacting the maintainers
of this layer, as well as instructions for submitting patches.

The meta-ivi project welcomes contributions. You can contribute code,
submit patches, report bugs, answer questions on our mailing lists and
review and edit our documentation and much more.

Using the above git sha's and the master meta-ivi branch, bitbaking leviathan-image
is known to work (the leviathan-image build should be aligned with GENIVI 10.0).

For creating a specific GENIVI compliant image version, please make sure you
git checkout the related meta-ivi branch and follow the build instructions
located in the README.md file of that branch.  So for example, to build
an image that should be GENIVI 6.0 compliant, checkout the meta-ivi 6.0 branch,
and follow the README.md part of that branch.  As does the GENIVI Alliance
we only support the current and the previous version.  Any version older
than that is not supported any more, and therefore may not build or run.

Supported Machines
------------------

We do smoke test the builds of the three machines that we currently support:

* QEMU (ARMv7) - emulated machine: vexpressa9
* QEMU (IA-32) - emulated machine: qemux86
* QEMU (x86-64) - emulated machine: qemux86-64

Please check on our [wiki](http://wiki.projects.genivi.org/index.php/meta-ivi)
regarding any community supported machines.
For example there Renesas provides a public Board Support Package (BSP)
available for use with meta-ivi.

Build a QEMU image that contains GENIVI components
--------------------------------------------------

You can build a QEMU image that should be GENIVI compliant using the
following steps:

1. Export TEMPLATECONF to pick up correct configuration for the build
export TEMPLATECONF=/full/path/to/meta-ivi/meta-ivi/conf

2. Run the following command:
   > $ source poky/oe-init-build-env

3. Build leviathan-image including GENIVI 10.0 (Leviathan) components
   > $ bitbake leviathan-image

4. Run the emulator:
   > for qemu vexpressa9:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu leviathan-image vexpressa9
   >
   > for qemu x86:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu leviathan-image qemux86
   >
   > for qemu x86-64:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu leviathan-image qemux86-64
